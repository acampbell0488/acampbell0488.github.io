My name is April Campbell-Love.  I am from Mississippi. I am currently an Adult Education instructor at a local community college. I have been teaching for about 7 years now. I received my bachelor’s degree from the University of Memphis and my master’s degree from Arkansas State University. I do not have any web application or development training. I am a complete novice when it comes to this area. My expectation of this course is to learn. I must admit, I am extremely overwhelmed because I do not have much knowledge in the field of coding or anything web application related. I am honestly hoping for the best. What I hope to learn with my knowledge is to be able to build a basic website. I would also like to understand the vocabulary that is correlated with web content. My favorite hobby is watching old series or sitcoms with my husband. We do not go out much, especially since the pandemic, so we love watching television together.
